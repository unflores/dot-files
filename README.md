dotfiles
============
These are my personal .dot-files files. The point is that you can easily define what you want and then easily pull and install them wherever you go.  The installation assumes installation in the home directory of the current user

Installation
------------
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:unflores/dot-files.git
./install
